[![Genre: Asymmetric Co-op](https://img.shields.io/badge/Genre-Asymmetric%20Co--op-purple)](#asymmetric-co-op-roles)

An asymmetric 2D co-op game. One player controls the **Flapper** (navigating through the level using vertical thrust impulses), while the other plays the **Builder** (placing temporary blocks and bridges in real-time to construct paths). The level automatically scrolls to the right.

---

## 🎮 Asymmetric Co-op Roles

This game requires **two players** working together with entirely different controls and perspectives:

*   **Player A (Builder) 🐦**: Places platforms, bridges, or temporary blocks to create a path. Has a **cooldown** between placements to keep it challenging.
*   **Player B (Flapper) 🏃**: Controls a character that flies with vertical impulses (tap/click = upward boost, constant gravity falling). Must navigate the course without hitting obstacles.

---

## 📡 Game Modes

You can play Flap & Build in three different ways:

1.  **Local (Single Device) 📱**: Screen-divided controls or split-screen interface on a single device (great for tablets or phones).
2.  **Offline LAN 📶**: Connect with another player on the same local Wi-Fi network. One player acts as host, and the other joins via local IP.
3.  **Local Server 🖥️**: Host starts an authoritative local server. The server manages all game logic (collisions, speeds, state validations), ensuring high integrity and synchrony.
